        <h1>IML 300 Discussion Questions</h1>
     </div>
     <div>
        <ul>
        <div Week 1>
            <li>Can advertising on a website be justified if it keeps the website afloat - otherwise we'd have no website at all? Does monetary success always in the end neuter an actualized experience online?</li>
         
            <li>Due to the grandiose nature the internet seemed in its early years compared to its matter of fact nature today, will we find it difficult to adapt to newer and grander niches of technology in the future? Or have we learned to learn technology?</li>
          
            <li>Will the existence of websites that aid in making one's own website neuter the potential for hyper-individualized websites as it introduces some form of reliance on template and not on "starting from scratch"?</li>
            </div>
          <br>
        <div Week 2>
            <li>How has one conceived the idea of even programming programming?</li>

            <li>As there's a rise in design complacency, will there be room for indigestible media subjective to few who can really interpret it? Or will our advanced systems hinder any sense of chaotic agency when it comes to design?</li>

            <li>When we find the point where technology can't climb any more, can we find a way to advance laterally in the context of technology? Example: RTX computing power has constantly climbed, but most people can't access the very best of it today only until years later when there's a better version to outmatch it, making the older version more affordable.</li>
            </div>
          <br>
        <div Week 6>
            <li>How might the mass digitalization of information and ideas neuter the intrinsic value or experience when taking part in such activism?</li>
            
            <li>Is the gain of efficiency and comfort worth it when, as a result, we become reliant on technology's existence and in some way it controls us?</li>
            
            <li>Is the longing control rooted from the inherent fear of loosing control - meaning chaos or the natural order is what we lack control over?</li>
          </div>
          <br>
        <div Week 7>
            <li>Does the "ephemeral" nature of memes reflect the mass overconsumption of media -  how there is so much passed around and streamlined information that at this pace make it tricky for people "out of the loop" to ever gage a point to even begin to understand the multilayered nuance of it all?</li>
            
            <li>Does the term "freelancer" ironically reflect a lack of freedom for someone in that position? Because, while they do have the freedom to move and mobilize to whatever corners of work they please, they don't much say in exactly what they are 'doing'</li>
            
            <li>Does the use of the glitch express a sort of chaotic nature in art, almost design through randomness or unpredictability? I come to think of Jackson Pollock in mind</li>
          </div>
          <br>
        <div Week 8>
            <li>How might the inadequate readings of dark skinned faces affect law enforcement's use of facial recognition technology when identifying criminal suspects that are a darker complexion - could it misidentify?</li>
            
            <li>How has the bias of data collection reflected the human bias of generalizing reality?</li>
            
            <li>What's the greater implication of the disenfranchisement of people's minds to the louder issues or struggles that don't directly affect them?</li>
         </div>
          <br>
        <div Week 9>
            <li>How might stories play into establishing a following toward a specific movement, leader, or group. Are stories all there is in rallying?</li>
            
            <li>Looking at the comments of "The danger of a single story", it was quite evident that during this time of a pandemic many people have been similarly assigned to watching this video for their own classes. Does this occurrence reflect the overall effect a stories has on a group?</li>
            
            <li>The mass collection of data and information certainly has its pragmatic implications on top of its dangerous implications. Because of those dangerous implications, should we even indulge in the use of technology at all?</li>
         </div>
          <br>
        <div Week 10>
            <li>Does the presence of surveillance decide the condition of society to be avoided of potential bad rather than longing for potential good?</li>
            
            <li>Does the museum of the future reflect an idealized vision of the future or more presuming potential negative conditions of the future? Or both?</li>
            
            <li>If surveillance is proven to be far more beneficial than it would be harmful, would that make it hard to protest against in the future if it does start to cause problems after it started to cause benefits?</li>
         </div>
          <br>
        <div Week 11>
            <li>Does the presence of surveillance decide the condition of society to be avoided of potential bad rather than longing for potential good?</li>
            
            <li>Does the museum of the future reflect an idealized vision of the future or more presuming potential negative conditions of the future? Or both?</li>
            
            <li>If surveillance is proven to be far more beneficial than it would be harmful, would that make it hard to protest against in the future if it does start to cause problems after it started to cause benefits?</li>
