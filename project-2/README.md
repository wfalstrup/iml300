A simple Chrome Extension that spawns a small cube upon each manual click. After each click, new cubes are born and older cubes get larger. Over time, the page is filled with cubes, hoping to make use of the internet a nuisance so you'd take a break. Made with p5.js


### How To Install

1. Download this repo as a zip file and unzip it to a local folder
2. Open the `chrome://extensions` page
3. Enable developer mode (if it’s not already)
4. Click on “Load unpacked extension”
5. Select the extension folder

### Other Chrome extension concepts I am interested in creating
* Concept 1: Browser Color Changer: Beyond simple dark/light modes being used on browser, have option to change select changeable areas to any color.
* Concept 2: Mouse reaction effect: Mouse clicks have a customizable effect on screen [water ripple effect, flash of light, etc.]
* Concept 3: Transparent mode: Can highlight over particular parts of browser to make transparent - whatever app underneath can be seen and used in tandem.
* Concept 4: Tab Change Hotkey: Be able to quickly go back to a previous tab like you would go back to a previous page - instead of having to search for the tab on the bar amongst many other tabs, you can quickly go to your last used tab if you are frequently going back and forth between them.
